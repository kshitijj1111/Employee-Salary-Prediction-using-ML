Employee Salary Predictor using Machine Learning & Generative AI
This project is a machine learning application that predicts whether an employee's annual income is greater than or less than $50,000 based on demographic and employment data. The project features an interactive web interface built with Streamlit and integrates a Generative AI model to provide human-readable interpretations of the predictions, making the results accessible to everyone.

🚀 Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build an accurate and user-friendly tool for salary prediction. It leverages a classic dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to train a classification model. The most innovative feature is the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) like Grok or Google's Gemini to provide an "Explainable AI" component, which translates the model's complex decision-making into a simple, insightful explanation.

✨ Key Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles missing values and prepares categorical and numerical data for modeling.

Multiple Model Training: Trains and evaluates three different classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) to select the best performer.

Interactive Web Interface: A user-friendly UI built with Streamlit allows users to input data via sliders and dropdowns.

Instant Predictions: Provides real-time salary bracket predictions based on user input.

Explainable AI (XAI): Connects to a Generative AI API to explain why the model made a specific prediction, highlighting the most influential factors.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

Web Framework: Streamlit

Generative AI Integration: OpenAI / Google Generative AI libraries

Environment Management: venv

⚙️ Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git]([https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/kshitijj1111/Employee-Salary-Prediction-using-ML.git))
cd your-repository-name

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Required Libraries
Install all the necessary packages from the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set Up Your API Key
To use the Generative AI feature, you need to add your API key.

Create a folder named .streamlit in the project's root directory.

Inside the .streamlit folder, create a file named secrets.toml.

Add your API key to the secrets.toml file. For example, if using the Google Gemini API:

GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key_goes_here"

▶️ How to Run the Application
Once the setup is complete, you can run the Streamlit application with a single command.

streamlit run app.py

Your web browser will automatically open a new tab with the running application. You can now interact with the UI to get salary predictions and AI-powered explanations.

✅ Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the entire machine learning pipeline, from data cleaning to deployment of an interactive application. The integration of a Generative AI for result interpretation adds significant value, making the complex predictions of the model transparent and understandable. It serves as a powerful example of how modern AI can be made more accessible and trustworthy.
